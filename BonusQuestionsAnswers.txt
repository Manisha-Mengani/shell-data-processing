 ### Bonus points:
 * Using only your intellect and script commands, which file holds the positive comments?
   File A hold positive
 * Which file holds negative comments?
   File B hold negetive
 * How did you process the data? How confident are you?
   Just had a look into the file and performed operations to retrive the content of the both the files using commands below commands
   * tr ' ' '\12' < A.txt 
   * tr ' ' '\12' < A.txt | sort
   * tr ' ' '\12' < A.txt | sort | uniq -c 
   *  tr ' ' '\12' < A.txt | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr > resultA.txt
   
 * I used below commands to differentiate the content holding by 
  *  $ cat A.txt | grep -i 'bad' -c  
  *  $ cat B.txt | grep -i 'bad' -c 
  * $ cat B.txt | grep -i 'good' -c  
  *  $ cat B.txt | grep -i 'good' -c
